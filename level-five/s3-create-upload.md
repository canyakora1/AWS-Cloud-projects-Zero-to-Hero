## Amazon s3 bucket creation via the AWS CLI
I'll assume you already have the AWS Cli installed and configure using the "aws configure" on your terminal locally or if you are using the AWS Cloud shell, there is not need to run the configuration, the shell is already configured automatically.

run:
aws s3api create-bucket \
--bucket <REPLACED_FOR_BUCKET_NAME> \
--region us-east-1 \
--profile <REPLACED_FOR_PROFILE_NAME>

## Upload objects into Amazon s3 via Mgt Console
Steps:
* On the AWS console, go to the search bar and type "s3"
* Locate the newly create s3 bucket, in my case it is test-bucket1212
* Click on the newly created bucket and located the upload button.
* Click the upload button
* You would be presented with a few options, "remove", "Add file" and "Add folder"
* Click add file and upload an object stored on your device.
* Click upload

## Upload objects via the AWS CLI
run:
aws s3 cpÂ index.html s3://test-bucket1212
- index.html is a file stored on my local device
- s3://test-bucket1212 is the uri for the target bucket
