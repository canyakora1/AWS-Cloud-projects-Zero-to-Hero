# AWS-Cloud-projects-Zero-to-Hero
I will be showcasing multi-projects that would build hands-on experiences on AWS

## Building hands-on experiences on AWS by doing projects

In the few AWS project demo, I'll be demostrating how we can biuld cloud skills and re-enforce our cloud learning by building real-world projects, either from the console or CLI. 

During this project timeline, we will be covering topics like:

- Setup AWS Account With Best Practice
- Get Hands-on With The Linux Command Line
- Master Bash Scripting
- Master AWS CLI
- Complete Complex 3-Tier AWS Project
- Complete Complex AWS Autoscaling Project
- Complete Multiple Real-World AWS Projects
- Simple to Complex Terraform Projects
- Simple to Complex Git Projects
- Simple to Complex CI/CD Projects
- Simple to Complex Python Projects
- Simple to Complex Serverless Projects 

## Requirements 
There would be a few requirements that would be needed to help us navigate through the project set-up and execution.
- An AWS Account (though I would be showcasing how to create an AWS account with security best practices)
- Familarity with basic programming knowledge (Python, Bash)
- Basic knowledge of how to use the terminal
- Basic knowledge of cloud computing

## Project structure
The demo would be structured in 'Levels' beginning from Level one to ten. The lower the number, the less complexity and difficulty. 

- Level 1: Creation an AWS account, IAM user and assigning policies
- Level 2: Deploying our three tier network architecture
